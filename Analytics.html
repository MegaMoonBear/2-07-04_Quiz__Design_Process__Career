            <p>After Meghan chose a representative title and ranked them she applied them to a 2-factor chart. <br> The chart ranks the job titles relative to Meghan's values and transferable skills. The chart's horizontal (x-axis) compares the job title to Meghan's values. The chart's vertical (y-axis) compares the job title to Meghan's transferable skills. The number of the job title from the prior table was entered at the <strong>intersection</strong> of the title's rating by horizontal values and vertical skills. </p>

            <img src="assets/CareerSelect_ValuesXSkills.png"> 

            <p><strong>Interpretation</strong> - The most applicable jobs to Meghan's values and skills are indicated by the yellow rectangle, which includes jobs 1 and 3 - Conservation Technology Specialist and Research Data Coordinator. </p>
